# Double Helix Module (Drupal)

#### Drupal Module for Making DNA Helixes (Helices?), 2016-05-13_

#### By _**Nic Netzel**_

## Description

_Created for Epicodus Drupal Week 4 Code Review Project: This is a Drupal 7.x Module. It takes user input for a string of DNA Nucleotides (letters A, C, G, T). It has form validation to prevent users from entering anything but those 4 letters, though it will allow and convert lowercase letters. Its output is the helix. Example:  "ACT"  becomes  "ACT/TGA"_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the Repository_
* _move the double_helix module folder to wherever you store contrib modules._
* _enable on your drupal site, or use `drush en double_helix` to run enable it_
* _functional and unit tests are dependent on the Simpletest module being enabled_


## Known Bugs
* _It seems like it also requires that the "Examples" contrib module also be installed, though this may be an issue with a different part of the site.)
* _I'm not entirely sure that the Functional Tests are actually testing anything or are as robust as they should be_.

## Support and contact details
